# PFS Payment Amount File

This file contains locality-specific physician fee schedule payment amounts for services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) with one record for each unique combination of carrier, locality, procedure code and modifier.

# PFS Relative Value File

This file contains information on services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated relative value units (RVUs), a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).

The Medicare physician fee schedule amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A geographic practice cost index (GPCI) has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedureâ€™s relative value unit (i.e., the RVUs for work, practice expense, and malpractice). The GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.

# Geographic Practice Cost Indices

This file contains the Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) component for each carrier/locality for 2024 as well as the locality/county crosswalk. The GPCI reflects the relative costs of physician work, practice expense, and malpractice insurance in a geographic area compared to the national average costs for each component.
