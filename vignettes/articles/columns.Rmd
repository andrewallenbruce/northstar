# PFS Payment Amount File

This file contains locality-specific physician fee schedule payment amounts for services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) with one record for each unique combination of carrier, locality, procedure code and modifier.

# PFS Relative Value File

This file contains information on services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated relative value units (RVUs), a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).

The Medicare physician fee schedule amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A geographic practice cost index (GPCI) has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedureâ€™s relative value unit (i.e., the RVUs for work, practice expense, and malpractice). The GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.

## Modifier

For outpatient hospital/ambulatory surgery center (ASC) reporting of a previously scheduled procedure/service that is partially reduced or cancelled as a result of extenuating circumstances or those that threaten the well being of the patient prior to or after administration of anesthesia, see modifiers 73 and 74 (see modifiers approved for ASC hospital outpatient use)."

fmod <- "For services other than those with a professional and/or technical component, a blank will appear in this field with one exception: the presence of CPT modifier 53 indicates that separate RVUs and a fee schedule amount have been established for procedures which the physician terminated before completion. This modifier is used only with colonoscopy CPT codes 44388 and 45378, or with G0105 and G0121. Any other codes billed with modifier 53 are subject to carrier medical review and priced by individual consideration."

Under those circumstances the technical component charge is identified by adding modifier TC to the usual procedure number. Technical component charges are institutional charges and not billed separately by physicians; however, portable x-ray suppliers only bill for technical component and should utilize modifier TC. The charge data from portable x-ray suppliers will then be used to build customary and prevailing profiles.",
    "Under certain circumstances, the physician or other qualified health care professional may elect to terminate a surgical or diagnostic procedure. Due to extenuating circumstances or those that threaten the well being of the patient, it may be necessary to indicate that a surgical or diagnostic procedure was started but discontinued. This circumstance may be reported by adding modifier 53 to the code reported by the individual for the discontinued procedure."

# Geographic Practice Cost Indices by State & Medicare Locality
