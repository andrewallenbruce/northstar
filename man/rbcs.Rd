\section{From BETOS to RBCS}{


The Restructured BETOS Classification System (RBCS) is a taxonomy that allows
researchers to group Medicare Part B healthcare service codes into clinically
meaningful categories and subcategories.

Based on the original Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) classification
created in the 1980s, it includes notable updates such as Part B non-physician
services and undergoes annual updates by a technical expert panel of
researchers and clinicians.

The general framework for grouping service codes into the new RBCS taxonomy
largely follows the same structure of BETOS. Like BETOS, the RBCS groups
HCPCS codes into categories, subcategories, and families â€“ with categories
as the most aggregate level and families as the more granular level.

All Medicare Part B service codes, including non-physician services, are
assigned to a 6-character RBCS taxonomy code.
